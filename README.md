Find an issue inside event

<!-- end description -->

## Changes in the 2022 release

### META CHANGES

- Configured to use [ACT](https://github.com/nektos/act) for testing github actions locally
- Build system now uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) to a Node16 bundle
  - i.e. `yarn exec esbuild src/index.js --bundle --outdir=lib/ --platform=node --target=node16.10 --sourcemap --format=cjs`
- Action now uses the new [GitHub Node16 runtime](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-05-20-actions-can-now-run-in-a-node-js-16-runtime/)
- New Jest tests have been added (still more required)
- Added prettier, eslint and shellcheck to keep the formatting consistent

## Previous Details Below

Extract issue key from string

For examples on how to use this, check out the [gajira-demo](https://github.com/atlassian/gajira-demo) repository

> ~~**Only supports Jira Cloud. Does not support Jira Server (hosted)**~~
> Now supports Jira server, and GitHub enterprise

## Usage

> **Note: this action requires [Jira Login Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/jira-login)**
