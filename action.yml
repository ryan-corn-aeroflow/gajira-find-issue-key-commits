  returns:
    default: first
    description: |
      Options can be: 'first', or 'all'

      This variable controls both how many results are returned,
      and how many results are processed.

      If the 'from' variable is 'pull_request', and this 'returns' variable is 'all',
      then base-ref defaults to the pull_request.base.ref,
      and the head-ref defaults to pull_request.head.ref from the github event.

      NOTE: This action originally returned only the first Jira Ticket ID found.
      For backwards compatibility the default is set to 'first'.
    required: false
  head-ref:
    description: |
      The Git Head Ref to which commit messages will be collected up to.
      If the base-ref is included, and the github event is a pull_request or push,
      The head-ref from the event will be used.
    required: false
  base-ref:
    description: |
      The Git Base Ref to which commit messages will be collected up from.

  include-merge-messages:

  generate-github-issues:
    description: |
      When a Jira Issue is found, the existing list of GitHub issues is iterated through,
      and if a GitHub issue starts with the Jira Issue Key, then the Github Issue is
      updated with details from the Jira issue.
      If the Github issue doesn't exist, the GitHub issue is created.

      If 'generate-github-milestones' is 'true', then the GitHub issue is linked to the milestone.

      If this action is triggered through a pull_request event, then when the pull_request
      is closed, and merged, the GitHub issues are also closed, by adding 'Resolves #<IssueNumber>'
      syntax on the pull_request body
